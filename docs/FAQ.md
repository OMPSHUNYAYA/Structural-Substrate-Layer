# SECTION A — Purpose & Positioning

## A1. What is SSSL, in simple terms?

**SSSL (Shunyaya Structural Substrate Layer)** is a deterministic structural layer that governs how scalar magnitudes are mapped into finite structural regimes.

It does not change physics.  
It does not modify equations.  
It does not predict outcomes.  

It introduces a **finite structural grammar** over magnitude evolution.

---

## A2. Why is SSSL needed if physics already works?

Physics answers:

“What is the magnitude?”

It does not formally answer:

“What structural regime is this magnitude in?”

SSSL introduces a finite regime algebra without altering classical magnitude.

---

## A3. Does SSSL replace classical electrodynamics or physics?

No.

SSSL is a **conservative extension**.

Collapse invariant:

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

Magnitude remains exactly as measured.  
SSSL overlays structural posture only.

---

## A4. Is SSSL probabilistic or machine-learned?

No.

SSSL:

- Uses a finite discrete alphabet  
- Uses no probability  
- Performs no statistical inference  
- Uses no machine learning  
- Uses no adaptive thresholds  

All behavior is **deterministic and replay-verifiable**.

---

# SECTION B — Structural Regime Algebra (A4)

## B1. What is A4?

`A4 = {Z0, Eplus, S, Eminus}`

Where:

- **Z0** — neutral equilibrium  
- **Eplus** — accumulation regime  
- **S** — stable plateau regime  
- **Eminus** — discharge regime  

---

## B2. Is A4 infinite or expandable?

No.

`|A4| = 4`

No fifth regime is permitted.  
No runtime expansion is allowed.  

Alphabet expansion invalidates conformance.

---

## B3. What does SSSL evaluate?

Given a scalar trace:

`m_i`

SSSL computes:

`X_i = (m_i, a_i, s_i)`

Where:

- `m_i` = classical magnitude  
- `a_i ∈ A4` = structural regime  
- `s_i` = deterministic accumulation metric  

Magnitude is never modified.

---

## B4. Does SSSL alter measured voltage, pressure, or magnitude?

No.

For all structural states:

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

Structural posture never alters magnitude.

---

# SECTION C — Deterministic Transition Discipline

## C1. How does regime assignment occur?

Regime assignment uses deterministic mapping:

`a_i = F(E_i, dE_dt_i, discharge_i)`

Where:

`E_i` = magnitude  
`dE_dt_i = (E_i - E_{i-1}) / Delta_t`  
(uniform sampling assumed)

Thresholds are fixed and declared.

No smoothing.  
No randomness.  
No inference.  

---

## C2. What parameters are required?

Minimal deterministic parameters:

- `tau0`  
- `taus`  
- `eps`  
- `drop`  
- `S_max` (accumulation bound)  

All parameters must be published and fixed per execution.

---

## C3. What is accumulation `s_i`?

`s_i = Acc_s(s_{i-1}, a_i)`

It represents deterministic structural strain accumulation.

It does not represent:

- Energy  
- Degradation  
- Failure probability  
- Physical damage  

It is structural only.

---

# SECTION D — Structural Admissibility

## D1. What is structural admissibility?

`adm_E(T) ∈ {ALLOW, ABSTAIN}`

It governs structural reliance over a trace.

It does not modify magnitude.  
It does not predict outcomes.

---

## D2. What does ABSTAIN mean?

ABSTAIN does not mean:

- Failure  
- Prediction  
- Instability  

It means:

The trace lies outside the declared deterministic admissibility envelope.

---

## D3. Does admissibility alter magnitude?

No.

Admissibility governs structural reliance only.  
Magnitude remains unchanged.

---

# SECTION E — Spectral Stability & Boundedness

## E1. What is the transition matrix `P`?

From structural sequence `{a_i}`:

`P(a,b)` is derived deterministically from transition counts.

It is not a probabilistic model.

---

## E2. What is the spectral condition?

Conformance boundary:

`rho(P) <= 1`  
`|lambda| <= 1`

Sealed evidence runs may demonstrate:

`rho(P) = 1`

The conformance requirement remains:

`rho(P) <= 1`

This guarantees:

- Finite regime closure  
- No structural explosion  
- Bounded evolution  

Spectral boundedness verifies **algebraic closure only**.

---

## E3. Does spectral analysis imply thermodynamics or equilibrium?

No.

Spectral boundedness verifies algebraic closure only.  
It does not reinterpret physical systems.

---

# SECTION F — Determinism & Replay Identity

## F1. What does replay identity mean?

Two identical executions must produce:

`B_A = B_B`

Byte-identical artifacts.

---

## F2. What artifacts must match?

- `sssl_states.csv`  
- `summary.txt`  
- `MANIFEST.sha256`  
- `P_matrix.csv`  
- Spectral outputs  

No tolerance windows are permitted.

---

## F3. Why is randomness prohibited?

Randomness breaks replay identity.

SSSL is machine-independent and execution-deterministic.

---

# SECTION G — Cross-Domain Universality

## G1. Does SSSL apply only to electrodynamics?

No.

Any scalar magnitude trace that satisfies:

- Ordered observation index  
- Deterministic thresholds  

can be mapped under SSSL.

SSSL has been verified across:

- Battery discharge  
- Mechanical vibration  
- Fluid pressure  
- Seismic magnitude  
- Domain-agnostic lifecycle traces  

---

## G2. Does SSSL unify physical equations?

No.

It unifies structural posture grammar, not physical law.

Each domain retains its governing equations.

---

# SECTION H — Scope & Non-Claims

## H1. What SSSL Does Not Claim

SSSL does not:

- Predict failure  
- Forecast earthquakes  
- Model battery health  
- Simulate physics  
- Replace electrodynamics  
- Inject control signals  
- Modify magnitude  

---

## H2. Is SSSL a safety certification?

No.

“Civilization-grade” refers strictly to deterministic verification discipline.

Deployment in safety-critical systems requires independent certification.

---

## H3. Does SSSL guarantee system safety?

No.

It governs structural regime assignment only.  
It does not guarantee physical outcomes.

---

# SECTION I — Architectural Summary

Layered view:

Magnitude Layer → Classical physics  
Structural Layer → `A4` regime algebra  
Accumulation Layer → deterministic strain  
Admissibility Layer → structural reliance  

All collapse through:

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

Physics remains primary.  
Structure becomes finite and disciplined.

---

# ONE-LINE SUMMARY

Shunyaya Structural Substrate Layer (SSSL) introduces a deterministic four-state structural regime algebra over scalar magnitude evolution, preserving classical magnitude exactly via `phi((m,a,s)) = m` while enforcing finite, replay-verifiable structural discipline across domains.
