# ⭐ SSSL Structural Regime Model  

**Deterministic Structural Magnitude Governance Framework**  
No Equation Modification • No Prediction • No Control Injection  

---

## 1. Scope

This document defines the formal structural regime model used by the **Shunyaya Structural Substrate Layer (SSSL)**.

It specifies:

- **Finite structural alphabet**
- **Deterministic regime mapping**
- **Conservative magnitude preservation**
- **Transition operator construction**
- **Spectral boundedness discipline**
- **Replay identity guarantees**

It does not describe physical laws.  
It does not introduce predictive modeling.  

It defines **structural regime topology only**.

---

## 2. Classical Preservation

SSSL preserves classical measurable magnitude exactly.

**Core invariant:**

`phi((m,a,s)) = m`

**Requirements:**

- Measured magnitude `m` is never altered  
- Domain equations remain untouched  
- No reinterpretation of physical law occurs  

Structural posture is **observational only**.

---

## 3. Structural Alphabet

SSSL defines a finite structural regime space:

`A4 = { Z0, Eplus, S, Eminus }`

**Properties:**

- `|A4| = 4`  
- Finite  
- Closed under deterministic mapping  
- Replay-stable  

SSSL governs **regime assignment — not magnitude evolution law**.

---

## 4. Deterministic Regime Mapping

For ordered observations:

`M = {E_1, E_2, ..., E_N}`

Define:

`a_i = F(E_i, dE_dt_i, discharge_i)`

Where:

`dE_dt_i = (E_i - E_{i-1}) / Delta_t`  
(uniform sampling assumed)

**Mapping properties:**

- Deterministic  
- Total  
- Threshold-based  
- Domain-agnostic  

No domain equation blending occurs.

---

## 5. Transition Operator Construction

From regime sequence `{a_i}`, define transition matrix:

`P in R^(4x4)`

Where:

`P_{ij} = count(i -> j) / rowsum(i)`

**Properties:**

- Deterministic construction  
- Finite operator  
- No smoothing  
- No probabilistic blending  
- Closed over `A4`  

---

## 6. Spectral Boundedness Discipline

SSSL requires:

`rho(P) <= 1`

`rho(P) <= 1` is the conformance boundary.

`|lambda| <= 1` for all eigenvalues.

**Implications:**

- Structural closure holds  
- No runtime regime expansion  
- No explosion mode  
- Finite alphabet invariant  

Spectral boundedness verifies **structural stability — not physical stability**.

---

## 7. Structural Admissibility

Define structural admissibility function:

`adm_E(T) in {ALLOW, ABSTAIN}`

Based on deterministic metrics:

- `avg_dwell_S`  
- `churn_ratio`  
- `collapse_ratio`  
- `count_S`  

Admissibility:

- Does not modify magnitude  
- Does not forecast events  
- Does not infer causation  

It governs **structural reliance only**.

---

## 8. Replay Identity Authority

Let:

`B` = artifact bundle produced by execution

Replay equivalence requires:

`B_A = B_B`

Where equality means:

- Byte-identical CSV artifacts  
- Identical regime sequences  
- Identical transition matrices  
- Identical spectral outputs  
- Identical `MANIFEST.sha256`  

Determinism is validated through **replay identity**.

---

## 9. Finite Regime Theorem

Under deterministic mapping:

`|A4| = 4`

Transition operator remains within `A4`.

- No additional structural regime may emerge  
- Vocabulary growth is prohibited  
- Structural grammar is fixed  

---

## 10. Conservative Extension Principle

SSSL is a **conservative structural overlay**.

It:

- Does not replace physics  
- Does not alter magnitude  
- Does not simulate dynamics  
- Does not introduce probabilistic models  

It governs **structural regime assignment only**.

---

## 11. Cross-Domain Universality Condition

If a system provides:

- Ordered scalar magnitude observations  
- Deterministic threshold publication  
- Finite regime closure  
- Replay identity discipline  

Then SSSL applies.

No domain-specific physics is required for regime governance.

---

## 12. Non-Claims

The SSSL Structural Regime Model does not:

- Predict failure  
- Forecast seismic events  
- Model battery degradation  
- Simulate mechanical systems  
- Provide safety guarantees  
- Modify physical equations  

It governs **structural regime posture only**.

---

## Final Structural Statement

SSSL regime governance is defined by:

- Finite structural alphabet `A4`  
- Conservative magnitude preservation `phi((m,a,s)) = m`  
- Deterministic mapping `F`  
- Spectral boundedness `rho(P) <= 1`  
- Replay identity `B_A = B_B`  
- Admissibility discipline `adm_E`  

Magnitude remains real.  
Physics remains primary.  
Structure becomes finite.  
Execution becomes deterministic.  
Verification becomes replayable.
